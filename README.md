# ObamaSpeechAnalysis

In this project, various NLP techniques such as topic modelling, k-means clustering and sentiment analysis are used to extract patterns from the speech of Barack Obama during his two consecutive presidential terms from 2009 to 2017. The goal of this project is investigate how external factors may influence the frequencies of different topics in Obamaâ€™s speech, as well as how different topics contribute to the polarity and subjectivity of the speech.
